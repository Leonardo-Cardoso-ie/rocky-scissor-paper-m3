Rock, paper and scissors (also known by other orderings of the three items, with "rock" sometimes being called "stone," or as Rochambeau, roshambo, or ro-sham-bo) is a hand game originating from China, usually played between two people, in which each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand. These shapes are "rock" (a closed fist), "paper" (a flat hand), and "scissors" (a fist with the index finger and middle finger extended, forming a V). "Scissors" is identical to the two-fingered V sign (also indicating "victory" or "peace") except that it is pointed horizontally instead of being held upright in the air.


### Introduction

 The Rocky Scissor Paper game is an application developed in Python, and is a very simple version of the rock, paper and scissors game, where the user chooses one of the three options and plays against the computer, and just type a letter R (Rock), P (paper) and S for (Scissors), being able to type both uppercase and lowercase letters. The purpose of this project is to put into practice the knowledge about the Python language acquired during the course
